# copilot-marketplace

Personal multi-harness marketplace of independently installable skill plugins. The skills use
the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) `SKILL.md` format, so the same
plugins install across **GitHub Copilot CLI**, **Claude Code**, and **OpenAI
Codex**, and can be reused in **opencode**.

## Install

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Open Copilot CLI, then register this marketplace once:

```text
copilot
/plugin marketplace add ericchansen/copilot-marketplace
```

Install plugins individually:

```text
/plugin install doc-generator@copilot-marketplace
```

Replace `doc-generator` with any plugin name below.

### Claude Code

Claude Code reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (kept byte-identical to the
Copilot manifest):

```text
/plugin marketplace add ericchansen/copilot-marketplace
/plugin install doc-generator@copilot-marketplace
```

### OpenAI Codex

Codex reads the repo catalog at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`:

```text
codex plugin marketplace add ericchansen/copilot-marketplace
codex/plugins   # open the plugin browser, pick this marketplace, install a plugin
```

### opencode

opencode has no remote marketplace — it discovers skills from local directories.
To use a skill, copy (or symlink) its skill folder into a scanned path, e.g. into
your global config:

```bash
# copy one skill (repeat per skill you want)
cp -R plugins/doc-generator/skills/doc-generator ~/.config/opencode/skills/doc-generator
# or into a project you're working in:
cp -R plugins/doc-generator/skills/doc-generator .agents/skills/doc-generator
```

opencode reads `SKILL.md` from `.opencode/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and
`.agents/skills/` (project and `~/` global). It ignores the `allowed-tools`
field.

### Fantasy sports

Install through the [harness instructions above](#install), using
`fantasy-sports` as the plugin name. In Copilot CLI or Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add ericchansen/copilot-marketplace
/plugin install fantasy-sports@copilot-marketplace
```

Then ask: "Use fantasy-sports to review my Yahoo fantasy lineup; recommend
only" or "Use fantasy-sports to review my Pick'em spread card and tiebreakers
separately." See the [skill and workflow references](plugins/fantasy-sports/skills/fantasy-sports/SKILL.md)
for draft prep, lineups, waivers/FAAB, trades, matchups and results tracking.
Other sports/providers require their own observed rules and supported access;
this plugin does not bundle provider APIs or browser tooling.

Installing on another PC carries the skill and blank templates, **not**
browser login, league state, team authorization or background monitoring.
The [private state template](plugins/fantasy-sports/skills/fantasy-sports/assets/private-league-state.template.md)
must remain blank in Git; populated copies need a user-approved private,
Git-excluded/untracked destination. No global setup is required by the skill.

## Repository structure

```text
.github/plugin/marketplace.json   Copilot CLI marketplace (source of truth)
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   Claude Code marketplace (byte-identical mirror)
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json  Codex repo marketplace catalog
plugins/<name>/
  plugin.json                     Copilot/Claude plugin manifest
  .codex-plugin/plugin.json       Codex plugin manifest
  skills/<name>/SKILL.md          Agent Skills (agentskills.io) definition
```

Skill helper files live beside their `SKILL.md` files. The marketplace
manifests are kept in sync by the `Validate` workflow. `copilot-home/` holds the
portable user-level config (settings, MCP/LSP servers, instructions) deployed to
`~/.copilot/` via `copilot-home/link.ps1` — see `copilot-home/README.md`.
