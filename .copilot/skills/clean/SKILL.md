# Post-Merge Git Cleanup

When the user signals a merge is complete and wants cleanup, execute this workflow. Be concise — report what you did, not what you're about to do.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify current state

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
```

Note the current branch name — if it's not main/master, this is the branch that was just merged.

### 2. Stash or warn about uncommitted changes

If `git status --short` shows uncommitted changes:
- **If on a feature branch that was merged:** warn the user that there are uncommitted changes on the merged branch and ask if they want to discard them before switching.
- **If changes are trivial (untracked files only):** proceed.

### 3. Switch to the default branch

Detect the default branch name:

```bash
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'
```

If that fails, try `main` then `master`. Checkout and pull:

```bash
git checkout <default-branch>
git pull --ff-only
```

If `--ff-only` fails, use `git pull --rebase` and report it.

### 4. Delete merged branches

Delete local branches that have been merged into the default branch:

```bash
git branch --merged | grep -vE '^\*|^  (main|master|develop)$' | xargs git branch -d 2>/dev/null || true
```

On Windows (PowerShell), use:

```powershell
git branch --merged | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch '^\*' -and $_.Trim() -notmatch '^(main|master|develop)$' } | ForEach-Object { git branch -d $_.Trim() }
```

### 5. Prune remote tracking branches

```bash
git fetch --prune
```

### 6. Report results

Print a brief summary:

```
✅ Cleaned up
  Branch: main @ <short-sha>
  Deleted: feat/my-branch, fix/other-branch (or "none")
  Working tree: clean (or list remaining untracked files)
```

Keep the output tight — this is a routine operation.

### 7. Suggest next steps

After cleanup, briefly surface what's actionable. Check these sources (in parallel when possible):

1. **Open PRs**: `gh pr list --state open --limit 5` — mention any awaiting review/merge
2. **Open issues**: `gh issue list --state open --limit 5` — mention unaddressed issues
3. **Changesets bot PR**: if `changeset-release/main` branch exists, note a release is pending
4. **Session plan**: if `plan.md` exists in the session workspace, check for incomplete tasks
5. **Session todos**: query the SQL `todos` table for pending/in-progress items

Synthesize into 2–4 bullet points under a `📋 Next steps:` heading. Use your judgement — only surface items that are genuinely actionable right now. Skip anything already done or blocked on external factors. Example:

```
📋 Next steps:
  • Merge Changesets release PR #36 to publish @wingmanjs/core@0.2.2
  • Issue #42 (add retry logic) is unassigned — pick it up?
  • 2 pending todos in session plan: "write integration tests", "update changelog"
```

If everything is clean and there's nothing pending, just say "Nothing pending — you're all caught up." Don't invent busywork.
